\begin{newlfm}

I am pleased to submit a proposal to form and lead the ``Age and Time'' research
group. I decided to apply based upon the steady encouragement of demographer
friends.
Had I not received such encouragement, I probably would not have applied due to self-selection on the basis of having few publications,
likely the lowest of any applicant. I'm still in the middle of harvesting my
dissertation and my current position at the Human Mortality Database has a small
research component.
Instead I apply on the basis of \textit{promise}, and I demonstrate this promise with
the merits of the proposal itself, my novel dissertation, a selection of
appended articles either under review or in draft form, and the good word of my
peers and and formal references.

Some committee members know me already. The following people also know me well
and are my formal references:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Joshua Goldstein & \small{Demography Chair, UC Berkeley} &
josh@demog.berkeley.edu
\\
Albert Esteve & \small{Vice director, Centre for Demographic Studies}, Barcelona
& aesteve@ced.uab.es\\
John Wilmoth & \small{Director, United Nations Population Division} &
wilmoth@un.org\\
Vladimir Canudas Romo & \small{Assoc. Professor, University of Southern Denmark}
& vcanudas@health.sdu.dk
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As you will see from the proposal document, the scientific prospects of this
project are exciting and diverse. Fund this project and I will build a team and
deliver. Thank you for considering my proposal and I hope to see you soon.
